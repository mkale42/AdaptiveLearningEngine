text,1,030101,6,"Two persons A and B are sitting on either side of a See-Saw. Person A is having more weight than Person B, it is an equation.
",False,,,,True,,,60,3,,2018.aaryan.raina@ves.ac.in,"Since, we know that, an equation is defined as a mathematical statement consisting of two algebraic expressions having the same value<br/>So, in an equation there is always an '=' sign and the expression on the right hand side of the '=' sign is called the RHS.
The expression on the left hand side of the '=' sign is called the LHS.<br/>Therefore, according to the question, LHS is equal to RHS<br/>Thus, Two persons A and B are sitting on either side of a See-Saw. Person A is having more weight than Person B will not form an equation",
